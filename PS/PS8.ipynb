Machine learning is essential because mobile phones are spreading in developing countries and capture behavioral patterns.

This research demonstrates that analyzing anonymized mobile phone records might help in predicting reliable individual and community wealth levels, at a lower cost and in less time. By surveying just 856 people and linking their responses to their phone usage, the researchers built a model that successfully estimated wealth for 1.5 million Rwandans and created detailed poverty maps down to village level—predictions, which matched official government statistics well. This approach could revolutionize how governments allocate resources and monitor economic progress in real-time, especially in regions where traditional data collection is expensive or not easy."
