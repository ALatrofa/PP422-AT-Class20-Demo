    "__Note__ Throughout the problem set, you may find it convenient (but by no means necessary) to typeset mathematical formulas. When working in a markdown cell, you can enter the in-line __math mode__ by wrapping an expression in the '\\$' symbol. Click into this cell in the provided jupyter notebook to see some examples, all of which use the general LaTeX functionality for mathematical typesetting. You can read more about LaTeX functions [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols). \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple formula can be written in-line. For example, writing ```$E = mc^2$``` will appear as $E = mc^2$, where the '\\$' symbol does not appear and is instead used to delineate the beginning and end of a mathematical expression.\n",

    "If you use the dollar-sign twice, that will separate out the expression as its own line, as in, ```$$E = mc^2$$``` which will produce:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = mc^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Latex is quite useful for subscripting as you can type an underscore `_` to add a subscript as in ```$x_i = 12$``` which produces:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i = 12$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax builds upon itself quite nicely when you need to add both subscripts and superscripts to more involved expressions (as in the below made-up formula):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda_i^2 = \\gamma_i + e^{\\alpha_i^3}$$\n",

    "If you need to write a longer expressions in subscripts or superscripts, you can wrap the whole expression to appear in a subscript or superscript in \\{ \\}. Below is a sample for the formula for the sample mean:\n",

    "Missing data also highlights the fact that there might be systematic biases: countries lacking 1993 GDP data tend to be poorer in 2019 and are disproportionately concentrated in certain regions and lower income groups, suggesting these were likely transitioning economies or newly independent states in the beginning of the '90s. This pattern means that any historical analysis excluding these countries would overestimate global prosperity, as it would systematically omit poorer nations and under-represent the true extent of global inequality."
